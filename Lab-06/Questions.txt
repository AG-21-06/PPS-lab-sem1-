Aim : To use loops for solving complex program
1)WAP to reverse the number and also check whether it is a palindrome using while loops
2)WAP to check whether given number is a perfect number (for loop)
3)WAP to check whether number is armstrong number or not (while loop)
4)WAP to calculate Floyd's triangle for the given number of rows (for loop)
5)WAP to find out prime number using while loop

Perfect number - It is defined as a postivie integer that can be expressed as the sum of it's proper factors (Factors except itself)
example : 6,28,496

Armstrong number - The number which is equal to the sum of the number's digits raised to the number of digits is known as an armstrong number
